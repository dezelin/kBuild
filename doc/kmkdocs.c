/** @design             kmk
 *
 * kmk is the make file interpreter and executer in kBuild. It is based on
 * FreeBSD make but some changes have been made.
 *
 *
 *
 * @subsection          Differences From BSD Make
 *
 * The main difference is that kmk doesn't make use of an external shell to execute
 * commands. It uses it's internal micro shell. This has a number of advantages
 * when it comes to portability. It also speeds up the execution a little bit.
 *
 * The other important difference is default makefile names and order. The names
 * and order is as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>makefile.kmk
 *     <li>Makefile.kmk
 *     <li>makefile
 *     <li>Makefile
 * </ol>
 *
